# ResetProject
This script will connect to a subscription/workspace/project and delete everything out of it. VERY DANGEROUS.
I often use a test project and populate it with all kinds of data. Then I need it all cleaned out again, and it is really tedious to do via the UI. 
This script will delete all User Stories and related Tasks from a specified subscription/workspace/project.
You will be able to create great damage with this, so use at your own risk - and very carefully.
